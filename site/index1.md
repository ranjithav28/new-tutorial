## C PROGRAMMING
C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion with a static type system.
*By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.
*A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct Unix's utilities.
*It applied to reimplementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.
*C is an imperative procedural language. It designed to compiled to provide low-level access to memory language constructs.

Example for C programming
main()
{
	print("hello, world\n");
}
standard - conforming
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
	printf("hello,world\n")
}
